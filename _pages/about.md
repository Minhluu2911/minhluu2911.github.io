My research interests include Computer Vision and Computer Graphics. Currently, I am a research resident at VinAI Research, where I am developing algorithms and techniques for **3D generative models** and **3D understanding**. I am dedicated to realizing my full potential as a science enthusiast, continuously striving to improve and seeking out opportunities for growth and self-refinement to discover optimal solutions.
